Whiskers: **Squeak** You did it! You actually did it! Those blasted rock puzzles had me stumped for ages, but you cracked them like nuts!
- Thanks! It took a while, but I figured them out eventually.
Whiskers: You sure did! And look at you now, with a rope, a basket, and even a massive cloth! Are you telling me you're finally building that hot air balloon you've been talking about?
- Yep, that's the plan! Time to head home.
Whiskers: Homeward bound, eh? Well, that's fantastic! I'm so happy for you. This cave has been...well, a cave, for far too long.
- You'll be okay here?
Whiskers: Me? Oh, I'll be just fine! Besides, someone's gotta keep an eye on these pesky spell books. I’ll stay here to make sure their power doesn’t get into the wrong hands.
- Good point. Well, take care, little buddy. See you around!
Whiskers: You too, champion! And hey, if you ever get the itch for another rock-pushing adventure, you know where to find me! Just don't expect it to be quite as easy next time!
